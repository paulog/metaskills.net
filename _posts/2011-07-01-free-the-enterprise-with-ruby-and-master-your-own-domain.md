  For anyone that did not attend the first <a href="http://madexpo.us/">MADExpo (Mid-Atlantic Developer Expo)</a> this week, here are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/metaskills/free-the-enterprise-with-ruby-master-your-own-domain">my slides posted on slideshare</a>. This talk centers around 3 basic sections.
</p>

<p>
  The first is general Open Source and what it can do for you as a software developer to increase your skills and general knowledge. Second, it covers some key open source projects I have been working on. Specifically for <a href="https://github.com/rails-sqlserver">SQL Server and and ActiveRecord</a> which includes projects like <a href="https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds">TinyTDS</a> and the latest accomplishments the <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/sql-server-10xs-faster-with-rails-3-1/">SQL Server adapter had done for prepared statement support in Rails 3.1</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, I go over what tools have recently been developed specifically for the Windows community to make using Ruby &amp; Rails an easy experience. One is the great <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">Rails Installer</a> project by Wayne E. Sequin and Luis Lavena. Basically a one click installer for everything from Git, Ruby, Rails, MySQL, TinyTDS &amp; the SQL Server adapter. I even did a new Rails 3.1 project called <a href="https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/AdventureWorks.Ruby">AdventureWorks.Ruby</a> which shows you how to get up and running with your legacy SQL Server databases. Specifically the hardest point, cloning your legacy schema to a fresh test database via the standard Rails' rake tasks.
