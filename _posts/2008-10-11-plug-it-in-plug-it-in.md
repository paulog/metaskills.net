  <img src="/assets/plugitin.png" alt="Jack Has Many Things" width="285" height="403" class="floatr ml20" /> I've been busy putting together some plugins form misc work. If you did not catch my latest article <em><a href="/2008/9/28/jack-has_many-things">Jack has_many :things</a></em> where I covered GroupeScope, by all means check it out. I've also just finished up a pretty solid backport of NamedScope that can be found on my Github page. It bills itself as a well tested complete back port for rails 1.2.6 and 2.0.4.

<p>
  One thing that has been a real help while I've been developing these plugins is this autotest class I put together specifically for developing rails plugins. I even got mention on rubyonrails.org. Sweet! More to come.
