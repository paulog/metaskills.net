  <img src="/assets/alumni_stamp.png" alt="The Pragmatic Studio Alumni Member" class="floatr ml20" /> Well, I just got back this past weekend from the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/index.html">Pragmatic Studio</a> in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/railsstudioboston/">Boston</a> and it was well worth the time and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WEATHER/05/17/new.england.flooding.ap/">effort</a>. If you have not yet used the RoR framework for web applications, stay tuned to my next post. By next week I will lay out an extensive tutorial on how to install the framework with all the proper goodies on your Mac. So do not wimp out and go for that <a href="http://locomotive.sourceforge.net/">easy package</a> install and dare to impress your friends as we build our own software installs with Darwin Ports.

  Remember, if you are new to RoR, I highly advise that you take the time to browse over to the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/bookshelf/index.html">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> and buy yourself some PDF books. I suggest starting with Chris Pine's <em>How To Program</em> and then moving on to the 2nd edition of <em>Agile Web Development with RAILs</em> mixed with brief dives into the Ruby language with the famous Pickaxe book.
