  It's a shame I do not do lifestyle posts more often, but with the <a href="/2010/12/27/let-it-go-moving-from-mephisto-to-jekyll/">new blog</a> I hope to change that. To that end, this article is dedicated to our Great Pyrenees Sasha who passed away from bone cancer last month. She was just 7 years old and we only had 3 weeks of good times from the point she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer. I am sure everyone loves their pet(s), we even have another dog and 3 cats. But there is something about a large breed, perhaps more so a Great Pyrenees, that made our loss really painful. It was also the first time I heard about the rainbow bridge, total tear buster.

  Luckily for us, we have a personal friend that breeds Great Pyrenees show dogs in Smithfield, VA and she just so happens to have had a new litter. Determined to turn a bad situation into something positive, we just up'ed our family by two more puppy dogs. You could say I RAID-1'ed my pyr puppies. So we now have a little boy and girl from the same litter. His name is Remy LeBeau and is on the left and her name is Sonya, pictured on the right.

  They are getting tons of love, attention, and good food. Raising two puppy dogs is so much fun, but it takes a lot of time and patience, especially when training them to go out doors with all the snow we have gotten lately. In the future Kelly and I will enjoy walking these guys around Colonial Williamsburg. Since they look like sheep, our Border Collie will corral them indoors for us as he did for Sasha. We can already tell that Remy will be the protector of the household and probably weigh in around 150 pounds when he grows up.
